1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,248
Plotly is a package of powerful
visualization tools to use with R.

2
00:00:05,248 --> 00:00:06,560
And in many respects,

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,984
Plotly is an alternative to ggplot with
a relatively easy to learn syntax for

4
00:00:10,984 --> 00:00:15,910
generating many of the same kinds of plots
that we've created so far in this course.

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,780
Plotly is also notable for

6
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,280
how easy it is to make figures
interactive using this tool.

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,929
With Plotly, and especially in
conjunction Shiny and flexdashboards,

8
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:31,142
you can replicate many of
the interactive figures of

9
00:00:31,142 --> 00:00:34,074
visualization software
like Tableau using R.

10
00:00:35,339 --> 00:00:39,196
If you really want to maximize
your visualization skills using R,

11
00:00:39,196 --> 00:00:43,460
you should take the time to
learn Plotly in its entirety.

12
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:47,395
And with what we've learned so far,
it shouldn't be especially difficult for

13
00:00:47,395 --> 00:00:51,170
you to transfer your knowledge about how
to code in R to use this new package.

14
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:56,424
However, in this course, we just don't
have time to cover everything, so

15
00:00:56,424 --> 00:00:58,269
we prioritize ggplot over Plotly.

16
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:03,760
The best resources for
learning Plotly are online.

17
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,738
Carson Sievert has a textbook that you
can purchase that provides a really nice

18
00:01:07,738 --> 00:01:08,588
introduction.

19
00:01:08,588 --> 00:01:14,190
And there's a free version of this
available online at plotly-r.com.

20
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:20,093
There's also a great set of reference
materials available at plotly.com.

21
00:01:20,093 --> 00:01:22,794
If you have time,
it's a great idea to learn to use Plotly,

22
00:01:22,794 --> 00:01:24,970
drawing on skills you
developed in this class.

23
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:29,989
Fortunately though, you don't have to
learn all of Plotly in order to make use

24
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:33,440
of it and to improve the visualizations
that we've created in GG plot.

25
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:39,318
Plotly has a special function that
interacts with ggplot figures to

26
00:01:39,318 --> 00:01:44,268
make those figures interactive, and
appropriately, it's called ggplotly.

27
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:49,122
The basic usage of ggplotly is very easy.

28
00:01:49,122 --> 00:01:53,804
And all you have to do is create
a ggplot figure and then take it and

29
00:01:53,804 --> 00:02:00,390
use it within the ggplot function in order
to use the special tools of ggplotly.

30
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,710
So let me show you how to do that.

31
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:07,202
Follow along with the R code that's
associated with this video, and

32
00:02:07,202 --> 00:02:09,998
I'm using an adapting code
here from plotly.com.

33
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:16,189
First, you install the libraries that we
need and load those up, and then here,

34
00:02:16,189 --> 00:02:20,146
I'm going to make some fake data,
pulling data from a normal distribution.

35
00:02:20,146 --> 00:02:22,061
This is what we've seen in the past.

36
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:27,010
We'll make a really simple
scatter plot using ggplot and

37
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:30,053
save that to the object
p into R environment.

38
00:02:31,613 --> 00:02:36,521
And from there, we just wrapped that
function ggplotly around the ggplot object

39
00:02:36,521 --> 00:02:39,924
that we've created, and
we say that to the object fig.

40
00:02:42,699 --> 00:02:47,226
Now if you run fig in RStudio,
you'll get the ggplot figure, but

41
00:02:47,226 --> 00:02:50,367
with the extra bells and
whistles of Plotly.

42
00:02:50,367 --> 00:02:53,409
Now we see that if we hover
the cursor over a data point,

43
00:02:53,409 --> 00:02:56,732
we'll get a pop up box that
displays data about that point.

44
00:02:56,732 --> 00:02:59,218
And you'll see that the plot
includes zooming and

45
00:02:59,218 --> 00:03:03,313
panning functions that you don't have
with a traditional static ggplot figure.

46
00:03:05,482 --> 00:03:09,383
You can follow this exact same approach
for many different ggplot figures.

47
00:03:09,383 --> 00:03:13,336
And it's worthwhile to spend some time
playing with line charts, bar charts,

48
00:03:13,336 --> 00:03:17,468
heat maps, and the other kinds of figures
that we've created in the course so far.

49
00:03:17,468 --> 00:03:22,073
And to see what kind of interactivity
comes up when you feed the ggplotly

50
00:03:22,073 --> 00:03:24,799
function a ggplot figure.

51
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:29,164
You can also go and make all the same
kinds of aesthetic tweaks that we've done

52
00:03:29,164 --> 00:03:31,581
before, changing labels and colors, and

53
00:03:31,581 --> 00:03:35,969
that sort of thing within the ggplot
figure before you feed it into ggplotly.
