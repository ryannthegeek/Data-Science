00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:05,568
So far we've used GG Animate to make
animations of a few different types of

2
00:00:05,568 --> 00:00:11,140
figures, and we've used different
transition functions in those animations.

3
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,416
There are a few additional visual
flourishes and tweaks that you can do with

4
00:00:14,416 --> 00:00:17,380
the animations, which we'll go
through partially in this video.

5
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:25,060
One additional aspect of an animation
that you can control is the entering and

6
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:25,731
exiting.

7
00:00:25,731 --> 00:00:30,014
And this will control how marks or
geoms on the GG plot will appear and

8
00:00:30,014 --> 00:00:33,410
disappear during the transitions,
the animation.

9
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:39,305
So to explain the example that's
in the GG animate documentation,

10
00:00:39,305 --> 00:00:43,013
we can first revisit the box plot
of the number of cylinders in car

11
00:00:43,013 --> 00:00:45,020
engines against the gas mileage.

12
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:48,510
We did this a couple of videos ago.

13
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,933
We can create the animation of this by
transitioning across the cylinder variable

14
00:00:52,933 --> 00:00:56,470
but you see the animation is very
choppy and it's kind of boring.

15
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:00,502
By adding different enter and
exit functions,

16
00:01:00,502 --> 00:01:04,630
you can specify the visual
look of these transitions.

17
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:07,667
And there are quite a few different
enter and exit functions,

18
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:10,308
which you'll find in
the GG Animate documentation.

19
00:01:10,308 --> 00:01:13,320
But with some experimentation and
following along with the different

20
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,597
vignettes or the examples, you will
see how these different options work.

21
00:01:16,597 --> 00:01:21,132
And you can play around with them to see
what you think is visually most suitable

22
00:01:21,132 --> 00:01:22,170
and satisfying.

23
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:27,518
Along with fading in and out,
you can also do what is called shadowing,

24
00:01:27,518 --> 00:01:32,120
which allows you to retain previous or
preview future frames of the animation.

25
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:36,769
And you can see shadowing demonstrated
here with the figure that we generated

26
00:01:36,769 --> 00:01:39,880
earlier with the number of Democrats and
Republicans in Congress.

27
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:45,948
What I've done here is use the shadow_wake
command and modified a few of the options

28
00:01:45,948 --> 00:01:49,554
to show you the shift in party
control of Congress across time.

29
00:01:49,554 --> 00:01:53,510
But including some additional frames in
the past so you can see it progressing.

30
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,408
As you can tell, you can really
get into the weeds on this, and

31
00:01:59,408 --> 00:02:02,830
you can let your imagination
run wild with GG Animate.

32
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:06,330
If you dig into the documentation,
you'll see that there are tools for

33
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:09,025
providing even more detailed
control of animations.

34
00:02:09,025 --> 00:02:13,590
Different options for modifying labels and
some other possibilities.

35
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,868
With the foundation here, you should be
able to interpret that documentation and

36
00:02:17,868 --> 00:02:21,780
make those adjustments if they seem
suitable for your own visualization.

37
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:29,240
The last thing I'll mention here about GG
Animate is how to export your animations.

38
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:34,600
The easiest way to do this is to save
the animations as animated GIF files,

39
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,818
G-I-F files.

40
00:02:35,818 --> 00:02:39,400
And you can use the function anim_save,

41
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:44,933
specify a .GIF filename and
input and saved animation object.

42
00:02:44,933 --> 00:02:49,221
And the animation will save to your
Our sessions working directory.

43
00:02:49,221 --> 00:02:52,220
And then you can then open it up
in a web browser if you want to.

44
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,778
Or you can find some other use for

45
00:02:53,778 --> 00:02:56,450
it depending on what kind
of media you're preparing.
